- Move around the transition information, it's currently too hidden
- Justify the usage of lots of contracts (cheap to deploy, and the infra makes it ready)
- Justify the no signature support, as you have the execute_from_outside snips, that allows to authenticate the issuer while re-using the existing infra.
- Remove the revocation info from the base information.
- Justify the fact that starknet now has the multicall tx support, so even with permissionned execution, you can still create the final attestation in a single transaction still.
- Remove the implementation guidelines for now, as they are not relevant for now, and loads the size of the spec.
- Go into more detail about ZK proofs, and how the standard supports that system correctly.
- Blast-proof the system.
